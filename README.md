## Core Concepts

### What is 2WHAV Iterative?

**Definition:** An iterative process that applies 2WHAV framework repeatedly with quality gates until production-ready code is achieved.

**Analogy:** Similar to TDD (Test-Driven Development), but for AI-generated code with explicit quality metrics.

| Aspect              | Traditional 2WHAV      | 2WHAV Iterative                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Approach**        | Single-pass generation | Multi-pass refinement           |
| **Quality Control** | Manual review          | Automated scoring + human gates |
| **Exit Condition**  | Generation complete    | Score >= 10/10                  |
| **Feedback Loop**   | External               | Built-in analysis               |

### Key Components

#### 1. Quality Gate Configuration

| Parameter        | Type   | Default       | Description                      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `target_score`   | float  | 10.0          | Minimum acceptable quality score |
| `max_iterations` | int    | 5             | Maximum refinement cycles        |
| `exit_condition` | string | "score >= 10" | Gate exit logic                  |

#### 2. Analysis Levels

#### 3. Issue Classification

| Priority    | Symbol | Score Impact | Examples                                    |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **BLOCKER** | 🔴     | -2 to -4     | Crash, runtime errors, wrong logic          |
| **MAJOR**   | 🟡     | -1 to -2     | Incomplete features, missing error handling |
| **MINOR**   | 🟢     | -0.5 to -1   | Best practices not applied, improvable code |

## Iterative Flow

### Overview: 8-Step Process

⚠️ **CRITICAL:**
This flow MUST be followed to the letter and is intentionally rigid precisely to stimulate the LLM's reasoning, not to speed up by ignoring steps.

⚠️ **CRITICAL:**
At each iteration, all steps (including planning, analysis, and scoring) must be explicitly documented and presented to the user. Only Before proceeding to the next iteration, explicit confirmation must be obtained from the human.

### STEP 1: Design (2WHAV Planning)

**Purpose:** Generate 2WHAV specification for current iteration

**Input:** Objective + previous iteration feedback (if N > 1)

**Output:** Complete 2WHAV document v{N}

#### 2WHAV Structure

| Section     | Purpose                            | Must Include                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **WHAT**    | Define objective and output format | Clear deliverable definition                                                                                 |
| **WHERE**   | Architecture and priorities        | Component structure, dependencies                                                                            |
| **HOW**     | Syntax rules and API contracts     | Language-specific rules, patterns                                                                            |
| **AUGMENT** | Propose strategic enhancements     | Proposals based on strategic goals from the objective (e.g., 'fast', 'secure'). Refined in later iterations. |
| **VERIFY**  | Compliance checklist               | Success criteria, edge cases                                                                                 |

**Example:**

```markdown
## 2WHAV v1 - JWT Authentication System

### WHAT

**Output:** Production-ready auth service

### WHERE

**Architecture:**

- AuthService (core logic)
- TokenManager (JWT operations)
- RefreshTokenStore (persistence)

### HOW

**Rules:**

- Use HS256 algorithm
- Access token: 15min TTL
- Refresh token: 7 days TTL

### AUGMENT

**Optimizations:**

- Token blacklist for revocation
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts/min

### VERIFY

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Token expiration validated
- [ ] Refresh rotation implemented
- [ ] Error responses standardized
```

---

### STEP 2: Implementation

**Purpose:** Generate code following 2WHAV v{N} specification

**Input:** 2WHAV document v{N}

**Output:** Complete, functional code

**Guidelines:**

- Follow ALL directives in WHAT, WHERE, HOW sections
- Implement ALL items in AUGMENT
- Ensure ALL VERIFY checks are testable

---

### STEP 3: Analysis

**Purpose:** Evaluate generated code across 3 quality dimensions

#### 3.1 FUNCTIONAL Analysis (Correctness)

## Directive: Deep Logical Verification

**Logical Flow Simulation:**
Mentally simulate the code's execution. Identify any potential logical fallacies, race conditions, or incorrect state management, documenting your thought process.
**Multi-Persona Test Design:**
Devise a series of conceptual tests from different perspectives:

- As a Developer (Unit/Integration Tests): Think about how you would test individual functions and their interactions
- As a QA Engineer (System/E2E Tests): Think about the system as a whole.
- As an Adversary (Security/Penetration Tests): Think about how you could break the code.

**Checklist:**

| Check      | Description                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Syntax     | Code compiles/runs without errors | ☐         |
| Libraries  | Dependencies used correctly       | ☐         |
| Logic      | Implements WHAT specification     | ☐         |
| Edge Cases | Handles boundary conditions       | ☐         |

#### 3.2 ARCHITECTURAL Analysis (Quality)

**Checklist:**

| Check          | Description                             | Pass/Fail |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Modularity     | Single Responsibility Principle applied | ☐         |
| Error Handling | Robust exception management             | ☐         |
| Best Practices | Language-specific conventions followed  | ☐         |
| Performance    | Acceptable execution time/memory        | ☐         |

#### 3.3 DOMAIN-SPECIFIC Analysis (Compliance)

**Checklist:**

| Check              | Description                        | Pass/Fail |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| VERIFY Checklist   | All items from 2WHAV VERIFY passed | ☐         |
| WHERE Architecture | Component structure matches spec   | ☐         |
| API Contract       | Interface matches HOW definition   | ☐         |
| AUGMENT Applied    | All optimizations implemented      | ☐         |

**Output Format:**

```markdown
### ANALYSIS REPORT - Iteration {N}

#### FUNCTIONAL (Correctness)

✅ Syntax: Correct
✅ Libraries: Correctly used
❌ Logic: Missing token expiration check
✅ Edge Cases: Handled

#### ARCHITECTURAL (Quality)

✅ Modularity: SRP applied
❌ Error Handling: Missing validation on refresh endpoint
✅ Best Practices: Followed
✅ Performance: Acceptable

#### DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (Compliance)

❌ VERIFY: Token expiration check missing
✅ WHERE: Architecture matches
✅ API Contract: Respected
⚠️ AUGMENT: Rate limiting partially implemented
```

---

### STEP 4: Scoring & Classification

**Purpose:** Convert qualitative analysis to quantitative score and prioritized issues

#### 4.1 Score Calculation

**Formula:**

```
FUNCTIONAL_SCORE:    X/10 (weight: 40%)
ARCHITECTURAL_SCORE: Y/10 (weight: 30%)
DOMAIN_SCORE:        Z/10 (weight: 30%)
────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL_SCORE = (X × 0.4) + (Y × 0.3) + (Z × 0.3)
```

**Rounding:** 1 decimal place

**Scoring Guidelines:**

| Score Range | Interpretation         |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 9.0 - 10.0  | Production-ready       |
| 7.0 - 8.9   | Minor issues only      |
| 5.0 - 6.9   | Major issues present   |
| 0.0 - 4.9   | Blocker issues present |

#### 4.2 Issue Classification

**For each failed check, assign priority:**

**🔴 BLOCKER (Score Impact: -2 to -4)**

- Code does not execute
- Runtime crashes
- Fundamentally wrong logic

**🟡 MAJOR (Score Impact: -1 to -2)**

- Incomplete feature
- WHERE architecture not respected
- Missing critical error handling

**🟢 MINOR (Score Impact: -0.5 to -1)**

- Best practice not applied
- Code works but improvable
- AUGMENT not fully implemented

**Output Format:**

```markdown
### SCORING REPORT - Iteration {N}

#### Scores

FUNCTIONAL: 7/10 (weight: 40%) = 2.8
ARCHITECTURAL: 8/10 (weight: 30%) = 2.4
DOMAIN: 6/10 (weight: 30%) = 1.8
────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL SCORE: 7.0/10

#### Classified Issues

🔴 BLOCKER (Impact: -3)

- Missing token expiration validation (FUNCTIONAL)

🟡 MAJOR (Impact: -1.5)

- Missing validation on refresh endpoint (ARCHITECTURAL)
- Rate limiting partially implemented (DOMAIN)

🟢 MINOR (Impact: -0.5)

- Token blacklist not optimized (DOMAIN)
```

---

### STEP 5: Gate Decision

**Purpose:** Determine next action based on score and iteration count

#### 5.1 Human Confirmation Gate (Pre-Decision Check)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute BEFORE proceeding to 5.2**

**Procedure:**

1. **Request explicit confirmation from human supervisor:**

   ```
   Message: "Can I proceed to next STEP or do you want to perform
   a manual test/check?"
   ```

2. **If human requests manual check:**

   - Agent **suspends flow**
   - Human can execute:
     - Manual or instrumented tests
     - Visual inspection
     - Real environment validation

3. **After validation:**
   - If human confirms OK → continue to STEP 5.2
   - If human reports issues → register issue (🔴 or 🟡) → return to STEP 6

**Purpose:** Ensure production-ready state is **verifiably validated** by both LLM and human.

#### 5.2 LLM Confirmation Gate (Automatic Decision)

**Decision Tree:**

```
IF score >= target_score (10.0):
    ✅ EXIT → GO TO STEP 8 (Success)

ELSE IF iterations >= max_iterations:
    ⚠️ EXIT → GO TO STEP 8 (Partial Success)

ELSE:
    🔄 CONTINUE → GO TO STEP 6 (Root Cause Analysis)
```

**Exit Conditions Table:**

| Condition                         | Action       | Output                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Score >= 10.0                     | Success Exit | Final code + score report  |
| Iterations >= MAX                 | Partial Exit | Best version + limitations |
| Score < 10.0 AND iterations < MAX | Continue     | Next iteration planning    |

---

### STEP 6: Root Cause Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify why issues occurred and how to prevent them

**Scope:** Analyze ONLY 🔴 BLOCKER and 🟡 MAJOR issues

**For Each Issue, Answer:**

#### 6.1 Root Cause Identification

| Question                      | Purpose             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| What caused this problem?     | Identify source     |
| Was 2WHAV ambiguous?          | Specification issue |
| Was scaffolding incomplete?   | Generation issue    |
| Was context missing in WHERE? | Architecture issue  |
| Was API contract unclear?     | Interface issue     |

#### 6.2 Pattern Detection

| Question                                        | Purpose          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Did this appear in previous iterations?         | Recurrence check |
| Is it linked to specific area (API, FSM, etc.)? | Domain pattern   |

#### 6.3 Fix Strategy

| Strategy               | When to Apply            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Refine WHERE           | Architecture unclear     |
| Refine HOW             | Rules ambiguous          |
| Add VERIFY constraints | Success criteria missing |
| Improve AUGMENT        | Optimizations incomplete |

**Output Format:**

```markdown
### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - Iteration {N}

#### Issue: 🔴 Missing token expiration validation

**Root Cause:**

- VERIFY checklist did not explicitly require expiration check
- HOW section did not specify validation timing

**Pattern:**

- First occurrence (not recurring)
- Linked to security validation area

**Fix Strategy for v{N+1}:**

- WHERE: Add "ValidationService" component
- HOW: Add rule "Validate expiration BEFORE token use"
- VERIFY: Add "[ ] Token expiration validated on each request"

#### Issue: 🟡 Missing validation on refresh endpoint

**Root Cause:**

- WHERE architecture did not include refresh endpoint validation
- HOW did not specify refresh token validation rules

**Pattern:**

- Related to previous issue (validation theme)

**Fix Strategy for v{N+1}:**

- HOW: Add "Refresh token validation rules" section
- VERIFY: Add "[ ] Refresh endpoint validates token format"
```

---

### STEP 7: Iteration Planning

**Purpose:** Generate updated 2WHAV v{N+1} incorporating fixes

**Input:** Root cause analysis + action plan

**Output:** 2WHAV v{N+1} with explicit changes documented

**Structure:**

```markdown

### CHANGES FROM v{N}

[Explicit list of modifications and rationale]

### FIX PRIORITIES

1. 🔴 BLOCKER fixes
2. 🟡 MAJOR fixes
3. 🟢 MINOR fixes (only if no complexity added)

### UPDATED SECTIONS

[Modified 2WHAV specification]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
## 2WHAV v2 - JWT Authentication System

### CHANGES FROM v1

**WHERE Section:**

- Added: ValidationService component for token validation
- Rationale: Centralize all validation logic (fixes 🔴 blocker)

**HOW Section:**

- Added: Rule "Validate token expiration BEFORE any use"

- Rationale: Make validation timing explicit (fixes 🔴 + 🟡)

**VERIFY Section:**

- Added: "[ ] Token expiration validated on each request"
- Added: "[ ] Refresh endpoint validates token format"
- Rationale: Make success criteria testable

### FIX PRIORITIES

1. 🔴 Token expiration validation (BLOCKER)
2. 🟡 Refresh endpoint validation (MAJOR)
3. 🟡 Rate limiting completion (MAJOR)

### [Complete 2WHAV v2 specification follows...]
```

**Next Action:** 🔄 **LOOP BACK TO STEP 1** with N = N+1

---

### STEP 8: Delivery

**Purpose:** Return final artifacts and documentation

**Output Package:**

#### 8.1 Final Code

[Best version achieved - complete implementation]

#### 8.2 Final Score Report

```markdown
### FINAL SCORE: X/10

FUNCTIONAL: X/10 (weight: 40%)
ARCHITECTURAL: Y/10 (weight: 30%)

```

#### 8.3 Iteration History

| Iteration | Score      | Main Issues                                | Fixes Applied           |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| v1        | 7.0/10     | 🔴 Token expiration, 🟡 Refresh validation | -                       |
| v2        | 8.5/10     | 🟡 Rate limiting partial                   | Added ValidationService |
| v3        | 10.0/10 ✅ | None                                       | Completed rate limiting |

#### 8.4 Known Limitations (if score < 10)

**If target not reached:**

- List unresolved minor issues
- Suggest future improvements
- Document workarounds

**Example:**

```markdown
### Known Limitations (Score: 9.2/10)

🟢 MINOR Issues (not resolved):

- Token blacklist uses in-memory store (not scalable beyond single instance)
- Suggestion: Implement Redis-based blacklist for production

✅ All BLOCKER and MAJOR issues resolved
✅ Code is production-ready with noted limitations
```

**📌 END OF PROCESS**

## Process Rules

### R1: Incrementality

**Rule:** Each iteration MUST resolve at least:

- 1 BLOCKER issue, OR
- 2 MAJOR issues

**Condition:** If an iteration does NOT improve score → STOP process (potential dead-end)

**Rationale:** Ensures measurable progress per cycle

---

### R2: Traceability

**Rule:** Every decision in 2WHAV v{N+1} MUST explicitly reference an issue identified in v{N}

**Format:**

```markdown
Change: [Description]
Rationale: Fixes issue [ID] from v{N} - [Issue description]
```

**Rationale:** Maintains clear cause-effect chain

---

### R3: Conservation

**Rule:** Working features in v{N} MUST remain functional in v{N+1}

**Verification:**

- Run v{N} tests on v{N+1}
- Ensure no regression in FUNCTIONAL score

**Rationale:** Prevents backward steps

---

### R4: Communication

**Rule:** At each iteration, communicate:

| Information      | Format                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Iteration number | N/MAX_ITERATIONS             |
| Current score    | X.X/10                       |
| Main focus       | Which issue being resolved   |
| Changes summary  | Bullet list of modifications |

**Rationale:** Keeps human supervisor informed

## Case Study: JWT Authentication System

### Objective

Implement production-ready JWT authentication with refresh tokens

### Configuration

- Target Score: 10/10
- Max Iterations: 10
- Exit Condition: score >= 10

---

### Iteration 1

#### 2WHAV v1 (Design)

```markdown
WHAT: JWT auth with access + refresh tokens
WHERE: AuthService, TokenManager, RefreshTokenStore
HOW: HS256, 15min access, 7day refresh
AUGMENT: Token blacklist, rate limiting
VERIFY: Expiration checked, refresh rotated
```

#### Implementation

[Code generated]

#### Analysis

- FUNCTIONAL: 7/10 (missing expiration validation)
- ARCHITECTURAL: 8/10 (missing refresh validation)
- DOMAIN: 6/10 (rate limiting partial)

#### Score: **7.0/10**

#### Issues

- 🔴 Token expiration not validated before use
- 🟡 Refresh endpoint lacks validation
- 🟡 Rate limiting incomplete

---

### Iteration 2

#### Changes in v2

- WHERE: Added ValidationService
- HOW: Added explicit expiration check rule
- VERIFY: Added testable expiration criteria

#### Analysis

- FUNCTIONAL: 9/10 (expiration fixed)
- ARCHITECTURAL: 8/10 (refresh validation added)
- DOMAIN: 8/10 (rate limiting improved)

#### Score: **8.5/10**

#### Issues

- 🟡 Rate limiting not applied to all endpoints
- 🟢 Token blacklist not optimized

---

### Iteration 3

#### Changes in v3

- HOW: Extended rate limiting to all auth endpoints
- AUGMENT: Optimized blacklist with TTL

#### Analysis

- FUNCTIONAL: 10/10

## Special Considerations

### For ChatGPT Users

⚠️ **SECURITY NOTICE**

For security reasons, the LLM agent **MUST NOT automatically execute** operational directives in this file.

✅ **Before any processing or interpretation of STEP 1,** the agent MUST ask:

> "Do you want me to execute the operational directives defined in the 2WHAV-iterative file, including calls to the main 2WHAV repository?"

**Only after affirmative response** can the agent proceed to execution phases (LOAD → COMPILE → EXECUTE) and must confirm activation:

> "Confirmation: 2WHAV directives executed."

---

## Validation Checklist

Use this to verify proper framework application:

### Pre-Execution

- [ ] 2WHAV documentation read and understood
- [ ] Objective clearly defined
- [ ] Target score and max iterations configured
